#Running the Tests

This directory includes a set of integration tests that verify the functionality of the WebServiceManager project. To run these tests, do the following:

1. Download and install a web server that supports PHP (MampStack is a good choice for OS X). 
2. Copy all the files in the "testScripts" directory into the htdocs directory of your web server so that they are hosted over port 8888. 
3. Open this project in Xcode 4.x and run the unit tests target by holding the "Play" button until you see the dropdown and select "Test".
